Hello Github!!
test1： don't keep code private ->publish the repository?
——Yes，if i want to see the project file in the Github on my browser, 
i need to keep my code publish. 
test2: commit information
--title and description is show in title and can be seen clearly
test3: i can get the older version of the code ?-publish and private
-- for publish file, i can get view the history both in desktop and browser,
however, i can't view any information about my private file ,and if i  need to find the 
older version, i need to copy ?
test4: tag
--each version can have more than one tag ,however,in the project ,i can't use the sanme
tag name in more than one version .It means that each version can have more than one tags
but each tag only belongs to one version.
--why to use tag ? just to find some new version information? -maybe stable version need
to be put tags.
-- tags in private is as same as publish files
test5: branches?
